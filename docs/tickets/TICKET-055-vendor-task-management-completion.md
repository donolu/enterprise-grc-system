## Task Automation Showcase

### 🔄 **Contract Renewal Automation**
```python
# Automatic task generation 90 days before contract expiration
def generate_contract_renewal_tasks(self):
    for vendor in vendors_with_contracts:
        notice_days = vendor.renewal_notice_days or 90
        task_due_date = vendor.contract_end_date - timedelta(days=notice_days)
        
        VendorTask.objects.create(
            vendor=vendor,
            task_type='contract_renewal',
            title=f"Contract Renewal - {vendor.name}",
            due_date=task_due_date,
            priority='high' if notice_days <= 30 else 'medium',
            auto_generated=True,
            generation_source='contract_expiry'
        )
```

### 🛡️ **Security Review Scheduling**
```python
# Risk-based security review frequency
review_frequencies = {
    'critical': 90,    # Every 3 months
    'high': 180,       # Every 6 months
    'medium': 365,     # Annually  
    'low': 730,        # Every 2 years
}
```

### 📊 **Performance Review Generation**
```python
# Spend-based performance review scheduling
if vendor.annual_spend >= 100000:
    review_frequency = 180  # Every 6 months for high-spend vendors
else:
    review_frequency = 365  # Annual for others
```

## Email Notification System

### 📧 **Smart Reminder Logic**
```python
@property
def should_send_reminder(self):
    """Check if a reminder should be sent today"""
    if self.status == 'completed':
        return False
        
    days_until = self.days_until_due
    if days_until is None or days_until < 0:
        return False
        
    # Check if today matches any reminder day
    return days_until in self.reminder_days
```

### 🚨 **Context-Aware Email Templates**
- **Overdue Tasks**: "OVERDUE: {task.title} - {vendor.name}"
- **Due Today**: "DUE TODAY: {task.title} - {vendor.name}" 
- **Due Soon**: "REMINDER: {task.title} - {vendor.name} (Due in {days} days)"
- **Completion**: "Task Completed: {task.title} - {vendor.name}"

## Professional Admin Interface Features

### 🎨 **Visual Task Management**
- **Color-Coded Status**: Pending (⏳), In Progress (🔄), Completed (✅), Overdue (🚨)
- **Priority Indicators**: Low (🟢), Medium (🟡), High (🟠), Urgent (🔴), Critical (🚨)
- **Due Date Alerts**: Visual formatting for overdue, due today, and due soon tasks
- **Automation Indicators**: Clear distinction between auto-generated (🤖) and manual (👤) tasks

### 🔧 **Bulk Operations**
- **Status Updates**: Mark multiple tasks as completed, in progress, or pending
- **Assignment Management**: Assign tasks to users or claim tasks for current user
- **Reminder Sending**: Send reminders for selected tasks with batch processing
- **Priority Changes**: Bulk priority updates for task management efficiency

## Advanced Filtering Capabilities

### 📊 **25+ Filter Options**
- **Date Intelligence**: due_this_week, due_this_month, overdue, due_soon (within N days)
- **Assignment Filters**: assigned_to_me, unassigned, created_by_me
- **Performance Analysis**: completed_on_time, completed_late, has_completion_notes
- **Integration Filters**: has_contract_reference, has_service_reference, reminder_sent
- **Automation Tracking**: auto_generated, generation_source, is_recurring

### 🎯 **Smart Query Examples**
```python
# Tasks due this week for current user
/api/vendors/tasks/?due_this_week=true&assigned_to_me=true

# Overdue high-priority contract renewals  
/api/vendors/tasks/?overdue=true&priority=high&task_type=contract_renewal
