# ADR-0008: Framework & Control Catalog Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Story 1.1 required implementing a comprehensive Framework & Control Catalog system for the multi-tenant GRC platform. The system needed to:

- **Support Multiple Compliance Frameworks** (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, etc.)
- **Enable Framework Import/Export** from structured data sources (JSON, YAML, spreadsheets)
- **Provide Control Lifecycle Management** with testing tracking and effectiveness monitoring
- **Support Cross-Framework Mapping** for organizations with multiple compliance requirements
- **Enable Evidence Collection** with validation workflows and audit trails
- **Maintain Framework Versioning** for regulatory updates and organizational changes
- **Provide Multi-Tenant Isolation** while allowing framework sharing and customization
- **Support Audit Requirements** with comprehensive logging and change tracking

The platform had grown to include sophisticated multi-tenant architecture, billing systems, and CI/CD pipelines, requiring a robust catalog system that could scale with enterprise compliance needs while maintaining data integrity and performance.

## Decision
We have implemented a **comprehensive Framework & Control Catalog architecture** using Django models with advanced relationship management, REST APIs, and flexible import/export capabilities.

### 1. Core Data Architecture

**Multi-Layer Model Structure**:
```python
Framework (1) → (N) Clause (1) ← (N) Control (1) → (N) ControlEvidence
     ↓               ↓              ↓
  Versioning    Hierarchical   Lifecycle
   Management    Organization   Tracking
```

**Framework Model Features**:
- **Versioning System**: Multiple versions with effective/expiry dates
- **Lifecycle Management**: Draft → Active → Deprecated → Archived workflow
- **External Integration**: Import checksums, source tracking, external references
- **Organizational Metadata**: Issuing organization, official URLs, framework types

**Clause Model Capabilities**:
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Parent-child relationships for complex frameworks
- **Rich Metadata**: Implementation guidance, testing procedures, criticality levels
- **Cross-References**: JSON field for mapping to other standards and regulations
- **Flexible Typing**: Control, policy, procedure, documentation, assessment types

**Control Model Architecture**:
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Planned → In Progress → Implemented → Active → Retired
- **Effectiveness Monitoring**: Testing dates, results, and automated scheduling
- **Change Management**: Comprehensive change log with user attribution
- **Evidence Integration**: Many-to-many with evidence artifacts and validation

### 2. Import/Export Framework

**Flexible Data Ingestion**:
```yaml
# Framework definition structure
framework:
  name: "ISO/IEC 27001:2022"
  version: "2022"
  clauses:
    - clause_id: "A.8.1.1" 
      title: "Inventory of information assets"
      external_references:
        nist_csf: ["ID.AM-1"]
        soc2: ["CC6.1"]
```

**Management Command Architecture**:
- **import_framework**: JSON/YAML import with comprehensive validation
- **export_framework**: Structured export with metadata preservation
- **setup_frameworks**: Bootstrap common frameworks (SOC2, ISO27001, NIST)
- **load_framework_fixtures**: Bulk loading with dependency resolution

**Validation and Error Handling**:
- **Schema Validation**: Required field checking and data type validation
- **Referential Integrity**: Parent-child relationship validation
- **Duplicate Detection**: Checksum-based change detection
- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations with rollback capability

### 3. REST API Design

**Resource-Oriented Architecture**:
```http
GET /api/catalogs/frameworks/              # Framework listing with filtering
GET /api/catalogs/frameworks/{id}/         # Detailed framework view
GET /api/catalogs/frameworks/{id}/clauses  # Framework-specific clauses
GET /api/catalogs/frameworks/{id}/stats    # Framework statistics
POST /api/catalogs/controls/{id}/update_testing/  # Control testing updates
```

**Advanced Query Capabilities**:
- **Filtering**: Framework type, status, criticality, automation level
- **Search**: Full-text search across names, descriptions, and metadata
- **Ordering**: Multiple field sorting with configurable defaults
- **Pagination**: Efficient large dataset handling with cursor pagination

**Specialized Endpoints**:
- **Framework Statistics**: Clause counts, control coverage, testing status
- **Control Testing**: Effectiveness updates with automated scheduling
- **Evidence Management**: File upload, validation, and audit trails
- **Cross-Framework Analysis**: Mapping relationships and coverage gaps

### 4. Multi-Tenant Architecture Integration

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**:
```python
# Framework sharing model
SHARED_APPS = ['catalogs']  # Framework definitions shared across tenants
TENANT_APPS = ['catalogs']  # Control implementations tenant-specific

# Data separation
Framework (Shared) → Clause (Shared) ← Control (Tenant-Specific)
```

**Customization Capabilities**:
- **Framework Inheritance**: Tenants can customize shared frameworks
- **Control Implementation**: Tenant-specific control implementations
- **Evidence Storage**: Tenant-isolated evidence with Azure Blob integration
- **User Attribution**: Tenant-scoped user assignments and ownership

### 5. Evidence and Audit Architecture

**Evidence Management System**:
```python
class ControlEvidence:
    # Evidence types: document, screenshot, log_file, report, certificate
    evidence_type = models.CharField(choices=EVIDENCE_TYPES)
    # Integration with document management
    document = models.ForeignKey('core.Document')
    # Validation workflow
    is_validated = models.BooleanField()
    validated_by = models.ForeignKey(User)
```

**Audit Trail Features**:
- **Change Logging**: Comprehensive change history with user attribution
- **Version Tracking**: Framework and control version management
- **Activity Monitoring**: Import/export operations with checksums
- **Compliance Reporting**: Audit-ready reports with evidence trails

### 6. Performance and Scalability

**Database Optimization**:
```python
# Strategic indexing for query performance
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['status', 'framework_type']),
        models.Index(fields=['last_tested_date']),
        models.Index(fields=['effectiveness_rating']),
    ]
    unique_together = [('framework', 'clause_id')]
```

**Query Optimization**:
- **Select Related**: Optimized relationship queries
- **Prefetch Related**: Efficient many-to-many loading
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass import/export with transaction batching
- **Computed Properties**: Cached counts and derived fields

## Alternatives Considered

### Simple Spreadsheet Storage
- **Pros**: Quick implementation, familiar interface, easy manual editing
- **Cons**: No validation, poor integration, limited querying, no version control
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for enterprise compliance requirements and API integration

### JSON Document Store (MongoDB)
