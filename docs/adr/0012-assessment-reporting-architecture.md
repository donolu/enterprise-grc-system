# ADR-0012: Assessment Reporting Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Following the successful implementation of Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 (Framework & Control Catalog, Control Assessments, and Evidence Management), the system needed comprehensive reporting capabilities to generate professional PDF reports from assessment data. The reporting system required support for multiple report types, asynchronous generation, and integration with existing assessment and evidence infrastructure while maintaining security and tenant isolation.

### Problem Statement
Organizations conducting compliance assessments need to:
- Generate professional PDF reports for audits and compliance documentation
- Create different report types: summaries, detailed assessments, evidence portfolios, and gap analyses
- Process reports asynchronously to avoid blocking the user interface
- Track report generation status and provide download capabilities
- Support both framework-wide and custom assessment selection
- Maintain security and tenant isolation for all report operations
- Integrate seamlessly with existing assessment and evidence management systems

### Existing Infrastructure Analysis
- ✅ **WeasyPrint Integration**: Already available in requirements.txt for PDF generation
- ✅ **Assessment & Evidence Data**: Complete models with rich relationships and metadata
- ✅ **Document Storage**: Azure Blob Storage integration with tenant isolation
- ✅ **Celery Infrastructure**: Async task processing capabilities already configured
- ✅ **RESTful API Patterns**: Established patterns for ViewSets and serializers
- ✅ **Admin Interface**: Django admin with advanced management capabilities

## Decision
We implemented a comprehensive assessment reporting architecture that provides four distinct report types, asynchronous PDF generation using WeasyPrint, and a complete API ecosystem for report lifecycle management while maintaining consistency with established patterns and security controls.

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Multi-Report Type Architecture
```python
REPORT_TYPES = [
    ('assessment_summary', 'Assessment Summary Report'),
    ('detailed_assessment', 'Detailed Assessment Report'),
    ('evidence_portfolio', 'Evidence Portfolio Report'),
    ('compliance_gap', 'Compliance Gap Analysis'),
]
```

**Rationale**: Different stakeholders need different views of compliance data - executives need summaries, auditors need detailed evidence, and compliance managers need gap analyses.

#### 2. Service-Oriented PDF Generation
```python
class AssessmentReportGenerator:
    def generate_report(self):
        # Generate HTML based on report type
        # Convert to PDF using WeasyPrint
        # Save as Document with proper metadata
```

**Rationale**: Separation of concerns allows for easy testing, template management, and future format extensions while leveraging existing Document infrastructure.

#### 3. Asynchronous Processing with Celery
```python
@shared_task(bind=True, max_retries=3, default_retry_delay=300)
def generate_assessment_report_task(self, report_id):
    # Background report generation with retry logic
```

**Rationale**: PDF generation can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Async processing prevents UI blocking and provides better user experience.

#### 4. Comprehensive API Design
```python
# Report lifecycle management
POST /api/exports/assessment-reports/              # Create report
POST /api/exports/assessment-reports/{id}/generate/  # Trigger generation
GET  /api/exports/assessment-reports/{id}/status_check/ # Check progress
GET  /api/exports/assessment-reports/{id}/download/    # Download PDF
POST /api/exports/assessment-reports/quick_generate/   # Create + generate
```

**Rationale**: RESTful design provides clear separation of report configuration, generation, and access while supporting both immediate and deferred generation workflows.

#### 5. Rich HTML Template System
```html
<!-- Professional templates with CSS styling -->
<div class="stats-grid">
    <div class="stat-card">
        <div class="number">{{ completion_percentage }}%</div>
        <div class="label">Overall Completion</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Rationale**: HTML templates provide maximum flexibility for layout and styling while being maintainable by non-developers and supporting complex data visualizations.

### Report Type Specifications

#### Assessment Summary Report
- **Purpose**: Executive overview of framework completion
- **Content**: Statistics, completion percentages, overdue items
- **Use Case**: Board presentations, management dashboards

#### Detailed Assessment Report  
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive assessment documentation
- **Content**: Full assessment details, evidence, implementation notes
- **Use Case**: Audit documentation, detailed compliance reviews

#### Evidence Portfolio Report
- **Purpose**: Evidence inventory and reuse analysis
- **Content**: Evidence catalog, cross-references, validation status
- **Use Case**: Evidence management, audit preparation

#### Compliance Gap Analysis
- **Purpose**: Systematic gap identification and remediation
- **Content**: Missing assessments, overdue items, action items
- **Use Case**: Compliance planning, remediation prioritization

### Data Architecture

#### Report Configuration Model
```python
class AssessmentReport(models.Model):
    report_type = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=REPORT_TYPES)
    framework = models.ForeignKey(Framework, null=True, blank=True)
    assessments = models.ManyToManyField(ControlAssessment, blank=True)
    include_evidence_summary = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=15, choices=REPORT_STATUS)
    generated_file = models.ForeignKey(Document, null=True, blank=True)
```

**Rationale**: Flexible configuration supports both framework-wide and custom assessment selection while tracking generation lifecycle and output.

#### Status Tracking System
```python
REPORT_STATUS = [
    ('pending', 'Pending Generation'),
    ('processing', 'Processing'),
    ('completed', 'Completed'),
    ('failed', 'Failed'),
]
```

**Rationale**: Clear status progression provides user feedback and enables proper error handling and retry logic.

## Implementation Details

### PDF Generation Pipeline
1. **HTML Generation** → Template rendering with assessment data
2. **CSS Styling** → Professional formatting with responsive design
3. **PDF Conversion** → WeasyPrint with font configuration
4. **Document Storage** → Azure Blob Storage via Document model
5. **Status Updates** → Real-time progress tracking

### Template Architecture
```
exports/templates/exports/reports/
├── assessment_summary.html      # Executive overview
├── detailed_assessment.html     # Comprehensive details
├── evidence_portfolio.html      # Evidence catalog
└── compliance_gap.html         # Gap analysis
```

### Security Implementation
- **Tenant Isolation**: All reports scoped to requesting user's tenant
- **Access Control**: User authentication required for all operations
- **File Security**: Reports stored in secure Azure Blob Storage
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Queries**: select_related/prefetch_related for related data
- **Background Processing**: Celery tasks prevent UI blocking
- **Storage Management**: Automatic cleanup of old reports
- **Template Caching**: Optimized template rendering

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Real-Time PDF Generation
**Rejected**: Would block UI for complex reports and create poor user experience with large datasets.

### 2. Single Generic Report Template
**Rejected**: Different stakeholders need fundamentally different report structures and content depth.

### 3. External Reporting Service
**Rejected**: Would create additional complexity, cost, and security concerns while breaking data locality principles.

### 4. Excel-Based Reports
**Rejected**: PDF provides better formatting control, professional appearance, and universal compatibility for audit documentation.

### 5. Client-Side PDF Generation
**Rejected**: Would expose sensitive data processing to client-side and create security vulnerabilities while limiting styling capabilities.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Professional Documentation**: High-quality PDF reports suitable for audits and compliance documentation
