# ADR-0011: Evidence Management Architecture for Control Assessments

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Following the successful implementation of Story 1.2 (Control Assessments), we needed to implement comprehensive evidence management capabilities for control assessments. The system required seamless integration with existing Azure Blob Storage infrastructure while providing intuitive APIs for evidence upload, management, and cross-referencing across assessments.

### Problem Statement
Organizations conducting compliance assessments need to:
- Upload evidence documents directly to assessments
- Link existing evidence to multiple assessments
- Manage evidence with proper categorization and metadata
- Cross-reference evidence usage across assessments
- Maintain security and tenant isolation
- Support bulk operations for efficiency

### Existing Infrastructure Analysis
- ✅ **Document Model**: Azure Blob Storage integration with tenant isolation
- ✅ **ControlEvidence Model**: Evidence management with validation workflows
- ✅ **AssessmentEvidence Model**: Many-to-many linking between assessments and evidence
- ✅ **Assessment API**: Complete control assessment management system
- ✅ **Admin Interface**: Django admin with inline evidence management

## Decision
We implemented a comprehensive evidence management architecture that enhances the existing infrastructure with direct upload capabilities, bulk operations, cross-referencing, and enriched API responses while maintaining consistency with established patterns.

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Direct Evidence Upload API Design
```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
def upload_evidence(self, request, pk=None):
    """Upload evidence directly to this assessment."""
    # Create Document → Create ControlEvidence → Link to Assessment
    # Atomic transaction with rollback on failures
```

**Rationale**: Single-endpoint solution provides optimal user experience while maintaining data consistency through transactional operations.

#### 2. Bulk Operations Architecture
```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['post']) 
def bulk_upload_evidence(self, request, pk=None):
    """Upload multiple evidence files to assessment."""
    # Process files individually with detailed success/error reporting
    # Atomic operations per file, continue on individual failures
```

**Rationale**: Individual file processing allows partial success scenarios and provides detailed feedback for large uploads.

#### 3. Evidence Cross-Referencing System
```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['get'])
def assessments(self, request, pk=None):
    """Get all assessments that use this evidence."""
    # Show evidence reuse across multiple assessments
```

**Rationale**: Enables evidence reusability analysis and compliance documentation efficiency.

#### 4. Enhanced Serializer Design
```python
class ControlAssessmentListSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    evidence_count = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
    has_primary_evidence = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
```

**Rationale**: Enriched API responses provide immediate evidence context without additional API calls.

#### 5. Admin Interface Enhancements
```python
def mark_as_primary_evidence(self, request, queryset):
    """Smart primary evidence management with uniqueness constraints."""
```

**Rationale**: Bulk administrative actions improve efficiency while enforcing business rules.

### API Endpoint Architecture

#### Evidence Management Endpoints
```
POST   /api/catalogs/assessments/{id}/upload_evidence/        # Direct upload
POST   /api/catalogs/assessments/{id}/bulk_upload_evidence/   # Bulk upload
GET    /api/catalogs/assessments/{id}/evidence/               # List evidence  
DELETE /api/catalogs/assessments/{id}/remove_evidence/        # Remove link
POST   /api/catalogs/assessments/{id}/link_evidence/          # Link existing
GET    /api/catalogs/evidence/{id}/assessments/               # Cross-reference
```

**Rationale**: RESTful design with assessment-centric operations for intuitive workflows.

#### Data Flow Architecture
1. **File Upload** → Document creation (Azure Blob Storage)
2. **Evidence Creation** → ControlEvidence with metadata
3. **Assessment Linking** → AssessmentEvidence relationship
4. **Error Handling** → Rollback on any failure point

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns with atomic transactions ensures data integrity.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Models Integration
```python
class AssessmentEvidence(models.Model):
    """Enhanced with administrative actions and cross-referencing."""
    assessment = models.ForeignKey(ControlAssessment, related_name='evidence_links')
    evidence = models.ForeignKey(ControlEvidence, related_name='assessment_links')
    evidence_purpose = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    is_primary_evidence = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

### API Response Enhancements
```python
# Assessment List Response
{
    "evidence_count": 3,
    "has_primary_evidence": true,
    // ... other assessment fields
}

# Assessment Detail Response  
{
    "evidence_count": 3,
    "primary_evidence": {
        "title": "SOC 2 Audit Report",
        "evidence_type": "document",
        // ... full evidence details
    }
}
```

### Bulk Upload Implementation
```python
# Multi-file upload with individual metadata
{
    "files": [file1, file2, file3],
    "title_0": "Document 1",
    "title_1": "Document 2", 
    "evidence_type_0": "document",
    "evidence_type_1": "report"
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Separate Evidence Upload Service
**Rejected**: Would create additional complexity and break consistency with existing Document upload patterns.

### 2. Single Evidence Upload Only
**Rejected**: Bulk operations are essential for efficiency when uploading multiple assessment documents.

### 3. Evidence-First API Design
**Rejected**: Assessment-centric design better matches user workflows where evidence is uploaded to specific assessments.

### 4. Database-Level Evidence Linking
**Rejected**: API-level linking provides better validation, audit trails, and business logic enforcement.

### 5. Separate Evidence Storage
**Rejected**: Leveraging existing Azure Blob Storage infrastructure ensures consistency and security.
