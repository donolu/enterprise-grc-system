# ADR-0016: Risk Management Architecture and Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Following the successful completion of EPIC 1 (Core GRC Platform) with comprehensive compliance management capabilities, the platform required risk management functionality to provide a complete governance, risk, and compliance solution. Organizations need systematic risk identification, assessment, and tracking capabilities that integrate seamlessly with existing compliance workflows while supporting various risk assessment methodologies and organizational approaches.

### Problem Statement
Organizations implementing GRC programs need comprehensive risk management that provides:
- Systematic risk identification and cataloging capabilities
- Flexible risk assessment with configurable impact and likelihood matrices
- Risk lifecycle management from identification through treatment and closure
- Integration with existing compliance controls and evidence management
- Analytics and reporting for risk governance and decision-making
- Multi-tenant isolation with proper user ownership and access control
- Professional admin interface for risk managers and administrators

### Existing Infrastructure Analysis
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Established tenant isolation patterns and user management
- ✅ **RESTful API Framework**: Proven ViewSet patterns and serializer architecture
- ✅ **Database Optimization**: Strategic indexing and query optimization patterns
- ✅ **Admin Interface Patterns**: Comprehensive admin interface with bulk operations
- ✅ **Documentation Framework**: OpenAPI 3.0 integration with interactive documentation
- ✅ **Authentication System**: Session-based authentication with proper tenant scoping
- ✅ **Notification Infrastructure**: Email reminder system ready for risk notifications

## Decision
We implemented a comprehensive risk management architecture using configurable risk matrices, intelligent risk calculation, and complete lifecycle management while maintaining consistency with established GRC platform patterns and preparing for advanced risk treatment capabilities.

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Configurable Risk Matrix Architecture
```python
class RiskMatrix(models.Model):
    """Configurable risk assessment matrices for different organizational approaches."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    is_default = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    impact_levels = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=5)
    likelihood_levels = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=5)
    matrix_config = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    
    def calculate_risk_level(self, impact, likelihood):
        """Calculate risk level based on matrix configuration."""
        return self.matrix_config.get(str(impact), {}).get(str(likelihood), 'medium')
```

**Rationale**: Configurable matrices support different organizational risk assessment approaches (3×3, 4×4, 5×5) while providing intelligent defaults and ensuring consistency in risk level calculations.

#### 2. Comprehensive Risk Entity Model
```python
class Risk(models.Model):
    """Complete risk lifecycle management with intelligent calculations."""
    risk_id = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    impact = models.PositiveIntegerField(validators=[MinValueValidator(1), MaxValueValidator(5)])
    likelihood = models.PositiveIntegerField(validators=[MinValueValidator(1), MaxValueValidator(5)])
    risk_level = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=RISK_LEVELS)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default='identified')
    treatment_strategy = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=TREATMENT_STRATEGIES)
    risk_owner = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='owned_risks')
    next_review_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    @property
    def risk_score(self):
        return self.impact * self.likelihood
    
    @property
    def is_overdue_for_review(self):
        return self.next_review_date and self.next_review_date < timezone.now().date()
```

**Rationale**: Complete risk entity captures all aspects of organizational risk management while providing intelligent calculated properties and supporting the full risk lifecycle.

#### 3. Service-Oriented Risk Management
```python
class RiskViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """Comprehensive risk management with advanced capabilities."""
    
    @action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
    def update_status(self, request, pk=None):
        """Update risk status with automatic note creation."""
        risk = self.get_object()
        serializer = RiskStatusUpdateSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            updated_risk = serializer.update_risk_status(risk)
            # Automatic note creation for audit trail
            return Response(RiskDetailSerializer(updated_risk).data)
    
    @action(detail=False, methods=['post'])
    def bulk_create(self, request):
        """Efficient bulk risk creation with validation."""
        serializer = BulkRiskCreateSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            created_risks, errors = serializer.create_bulk_risks()
            return Response({
                'created_count': len(created_risks),
                'error_count': len(errors),
                'risks': RiskListSerializer(created_risks, many=True).data
            })
```

**Rationale**: Service-oriented approach with custom actions provides sophisticated risk management operations while maintaining RESTful principles and supporting bulk operations for efficiency.

#### 4. Advanced Filtering and Analytics Architecture
```python
class RiskFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
    """Comprehensive filtering for risk management and reporting."""
    risk_level = django_filters.MultipleChoiceFilter(field_name='risk_level')
    status = django_filters.MultipleChoiceFilter(field_name='status')
    overdue_review = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_overdue_review')
    high_priority = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_high_priority')
    my_risks = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_my_risks')
    
    def filter_overdue_review(self, queryset, name, value):
        if value:
            return queryset.filter(next_review_date__lt=timezone.now().date())
        return queryset
```

**Rationale**: Advanced filtering enables sophisticated risk analysis and reporting while supporting common use cases like "my risks" and "overdue reviews" for operational efficiency.

#### 5. Risk Notes and Audit Trail System
```python
class RiskNote(models.Model):
    """Comprehensive audit trail and progress tracking for risks."""
    risk = models.ForeignKey(Risk, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='notes')
    note = models.TextField()
    note_type = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=NOTE_TYPES, default='general')
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='risk_notes')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']
```

**Rationale**: Comprehensive audit trail supports compliance requirements and risk governance while providing categorized notes for different types of risk-related activities.

### Risk Assessment and Calculation Logic

#### 1. Intelligent Risk Level Calculation
```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # Auto-generate risk_id if not provided
    if not self.risk_id:
        self.risk_id = self._generate_risk_id()
    
    # Calculate risk level based on impact and likelihood
    self.risk_level = self._calculate_risk_level()
    
    # Update assessment dates
    if self.pk:
        original = Risk.objects.get(pk=self.pk)
        if original.impact != self.impact or original.likelihood != self.likelihood:
            self.last_assessed_date = timezone.now().date()
    
    super().save(*args, **kwargs)

def _calculate_risk_level(self):
    """Intelligent risk level calculation with matrix support."""
    if self.risk_matrix:
        return self.risk_matrix.calculate_risk_level(self.impact, self.likelihood)
    
    # Fallback calculation using default logic
    total = self.impact + self.likelihood
    if total <= 3:
        return 'low'
    elif total <= 5:
        return 'medium'
    elif total <= 7:
        return 'high'
    else:
        return 'critical'
```

#### 2. Risk Review and Overdue Management
```python
@property
def is_overdue_for_review(self):
    """Determine if risk review is overdue."""
    if not self.next_review_date:
        return False
    return self.next_review_date < timezone.now().date()

@property
def days_until_review(self):
    """Calculate days until next review (negative if overdue)."""
    if not self.next_review_date:
        return None
    delta = self.next_review_date - timezone.now().date()
    return delta.days
```

### Database Architecture and Performance

#### 1. Strategic Index Design
```python
class Meta:
    ordering = ['-risk_level', '-impact', '-likelihood', 'title']
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['status', 'risk_level']),      # Status reporting
        models.Index(fields=['risk_owner', 'status']),     # Owner dashboards
        models.Index(fields=['next_review_date']),          # Review scheduling
        models.Index(fields=['category', 'risk_level']),    # Category analysis
    ]
```

**Rationale**: Strategic indexing optimizes common query patterns for risk reporting, owner dashboards, review scheduling, and category analysis.

#### 2. Foreign Key Relationships
```python
# Risk ownership and responsibility
risk_owner = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='owned_risks', null=True, blank=True)
created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='created_risks', null=True)

# Risk classification and assessment
category = models.ForeignKey(RiskCategory, related_name='risks', null=True, blank=True)
risk_matrix = models.ForeignKey(RiskMatrix, null=True, blank=True)
```

**Rationale**: Well-defined relationships support risk ownership tracking, categorization, and flexible matrix assignment while maintaining referential integrity.

### Admin Interface and User Experience

#### 1. Enhanced Risk Administration
```python
@admin.register(Risk)
class RiskAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """Professional risk management interface with visual indicators."""
    list_display = [
        'risk_id', 'title', 'risk_level_colored', 'risk_score_display',
        'status_colored', 'risk_owner_display', 'next_review_display'
    ]
    
    def risk_level_colored(self, obj):
        """Color-coded risk level display."""
        colors = {'low': '#10B981', 'medium': '#F59E0B', 'high': '#EF4444', 'critical': '#DC2626'}
        return format_html('<span style="color: {};">{}</span>', 
                          colors.get(obj.risk_level), obj.get_risk_level_display())
    
    def next_review_display(self, obj):
        """Overdue review warning display."""
        if obj.is_overdue_for_review:
            return format_html('<span style="color: #DC2626;">Overdue: {}</span>', obj.next_review_date)
        return obj.next_review_date
```

#### 2. Bulk Operations and Efficiency
```python
actions = [
    'mark_as_assessed',
    'mark_as_treatment_planned', 
    'mark_as_mitigated',
    'set_next_review_date',
    'bulk_assign_owner',
]

def mark_as_mitigated(self, request, queryset):
    """Bulk status update with user feedback."""
    count = queryset.update(status='mitigated')
    self.message_user(request, f'Successfully marked {count} risks as mitigated.')
```

**Rationale**: Professional admin interface with visual indicators and bulk operations supports efficient risk management while providing immediate visual feedback on risk status and priorities.
