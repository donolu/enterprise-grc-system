# ADR-0007: Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline with Security Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Story 0.7 required implementing a production-ready CI/CD pipeline for the multi-tenant GRC platform. The system needed:

- **Automated testing** across all application layers (backend, frontend, integration)
- **Security-first approach** with comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **Multi-environment deployment** with staging and production pipelines
- **Zero-downtime deployments** with automatic rollback capabilities
- **Quality gates** preventing broken code from reaching production
- **Developer productivity** through automated workflows and fast feedback
- **Compliance readiness** with audit trails and security scanning

The platform had grown to include complex multi-tenant architecture, Stripe billing, Azure storage integration, and sophisticated limit override workflows, requiring a robust CI/CD system to maintain quality and security at scale.

## Decision
We have implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** with integrated security scanning, multi-stage deployments, and production-ready automation.

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI) Architecture
**Multi-Service Testing Environment**:
```yaml
services:
  postgres: postgres:16
  redis: redis:7  
  azurite: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite:latest
```

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy**:
- **Backend Tests**: Django/pytest with full service dependencies
- **Frontend Tests**: Node.js/npm with coverage reporting
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Code Quality**: Black, Flake8, mypy, isort enforcement
- **Security Scanning**: Multiple layers of vulnerability detection

**Test Configuration**:
```python
# test.py settings optimized for CI
DATABASES = {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django_tenants.postgresql_backend'}}
CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True  # Synchronous task execution
PASSWORD_HASHERS = ['django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher']  # Fast hashing
```

### 2. Security-First CI/CD Approach
**Multi-Layer Security Scanning**:

**Dependency Vulnerability Analysis**:
- **Python**: Safety scanner for known CVEs in Python packages
- **Node.js**: npm audit for frontend dependency vulnerabilities
- **License Compliance**: pip-licenses for license compatibility checking

**Static Code Analysis**:
- **Bandit**: Python security linter for common vulnerabilities
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis for complex security patterns
- **TruffleHog**: Secrets detection across entire repository history

**Infrastructure Security**:
- **Hadolint**: Dockerfile best practices and security linting
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure-as-code security scanning
- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning

**Security Workflow Integration**:
```yaml
security-scan:
  needs: [test-backend, test-frontend]
  steps:
    - bandit -r app/ --format sarif
    - safety check --output json
    - trufflehog --only-verified
```

### 3. Multi-Stage Deployment Pipeline
**Deployment Stages**:
1. **Build & Push**: Multi-platform Docker image with GHCR
2. **Staging Deployment**: Automated deployment with basic validation
3. **Production Deployment**: Manual approval gate with comprehensive checks
4. **Rollback**: Automated failure detection and rollback capability

**Production Deployment Safeguards**:
```yaml
deploy-production:
  environment: production  # Requires manual approval
  needs: [build-and-push, deploy-staging]
  steps:
    - create_database_backup
    - deploy_with_health_checks  
    - run_smoke_tests
    - notify_success_or_rollback
```

**Environment Protection**:
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment from main branch
- **Production**: Manual approval + 30-minute cooling-off period
- **Rollback**: Automated on health check failures

### 4. Production-Ready Infrastructure
**Multi-Stage Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim as builder
# Build dependencies and virtual environment

FROM python:3.12-slim as production  
# Runtime-only dependencies, non-root user
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f /health/
```

**Security Hardening**:
- Non-root user execution (`appuser:appuser`)
- Minimal runtime dependencies
- Security headers in production settings
- Comprehensive health check endpoints

**Health Check System**:
- `/health/` - Comprehensive system health
- `/health/ready/` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `/health/live/` - Kubernetes liveness probe  
- `/health/startup/` - Container startup verification

### 5. Database Migration Strategy
**Zero-Downtime Migration Approach**:
```bash
# Automated migration workflow
python manage.py migrate_schemas --shared    # Public schema
python manage.py migrate_schemas --tenant    # All tenant schemas
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput     # Static files
```

**Migration Safeguards**:
- Pre-deployment database backups
- Migration validation in staging environment
- Automatic rollback triggers on migration failures
- Tenant-aware migration handling

### 6. Quality Assurance Framework
**Code Quality Standards**:
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py312']

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--cov=app --cov-fail-under=70"
```

**Quality Gates**:
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 70% code coverage requirement
- **Code Formatting**: Black formatter enforcement
- **Linting**: Flake8 with Django-specific rules
- **Type Checking**: mypy static type analysis
- **Import Organization**: isort for consistent import structure

**Testing Framework**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_tenant(db):
    tenant = Tenant(name="Test Company", schema_name="test")
    tenant.save()
    return tenant

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_full_workflow(test_tenant, free_plan):
    # End-to-end workflow testing
```

### 7. Developer Experience Optimization
**Pull Request Automation**:
- Comprehensive PR templates with security checklists
- Automated status checks blocking merge until all tests pass
- Branch protection requiring 2 approvals and up-to-date branches
- Automatic security scan comments on PRs

**Dependency Management**:
```yaml
# Dependabot configuration
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    schedule: { interval: "weekly" }
  - package-ecosystem: "docker" 
    schedule: { interval: "weekly" }
```

**Issue Templates**:
- Bug reports with environment and reproduction steps
- Feature requests with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Security issue templates for responsible disclosure

## Alternatives Considered

### Jenkins
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, extensive plugin library, self-hosted control
- **Cons**: Infrastructure overhead, security management complexity, slower feedback
- **Rejected**: GitHub Actions provides better integration with existing GitHub workflow

### GitLab CI/CD
- **Pros**: Integrated DevOps platform, strong security features
- **Cons**: Migration complexity, different ecosystem, licensing costs
- **Rejected**: Team already familiar with GitHub ecosystem

### Azure DevOps
- **Pros**: Native Azure integration, strong enterprise features
- **Cons**: Additional service complexity, less integrated with code review
- **Rejected**: GitHub Actions sufficient with better developer experience

### CircleCI
- **Pros**: Fast execution, good Docker support, parallel testing
- **Cons**: Additional cost, less tight integration with GitHub features
- **Rejected**: GitHub Actions provides equivalent functionality at lower cost

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Developer Productivity**: Automated testing and deployment reduces manual overhead
- **Security Posture**: Multi-layer security scanning catches vulnerabilities early

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple workflow files and configurations to maintain
- **GitHub Dependency**: Tied to GitHub Actions ecosystem and limitations
- **Cost**: GitHub Actions minutes consumption for comprehensive testing
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand workflow syntax and debugging

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Pipeline Failures**: Mitigated by comprehensive error handling and notifications
- **Security Tool False Positives**: Mitigated by tool configuration and manual review
