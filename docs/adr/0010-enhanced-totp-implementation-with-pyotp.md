# ADR-0010: Enhanced TOTP Implementation with PyOTP

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During the implementation of comprehensive 2FA functionality (covered in the foundational work), we encountered a critical Unicode encoding issue with TOTP QR code generation. The django-otp library's binary key handling caused `UnicodeDecodeError` during JSON serialization in Django REST Framework responses, preventing users from easily setting up TOTP authentication via QR codes.

### Problem Statement
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xde in position 1: invalid continuation byte
```

This error occurred in the `/api/auth/2fa/setup-totp/` endpoint when attempting to return QR code data and manual keys for authenticator app setup. The issue was traced to django-otp's `TOTPDevice.bin_key` binary data handling during JSON serialization.

### Impact Assessment
- **Functionality Impact:** High - TOTP setup was completely broken for QR code scanning
- **User Experience Impact:** Critical - Users couldn't easily set up 2FA 
- **Security Impact:** Medium - Reduced 2FA adoption due to poor UX
- **Business Impact:** High - Core security feature unusable

## Decision
We decided to implement an enhanced TOTP service using the `pyotp` library alongside the existing django-otp infrastructure, creating a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both libraries while eliminating the Unicode encoding issues.

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Hybrid Library Approach
- **Keep django-otp**: Maintain existing device management and Django admin integration
- **Add pyotp**: Use for clean secret generation and QR code creation
- **Bridge Integration**: Create service layer that connects both libraries seamlessly

**Rationale**: This approach minimizes disruption to existing 2FA infrastructure while solving the encoding issues.

#### 2. Enhanced TOTP Service Layer
```python
class TOTPService:
    """Enhanced TOTP service using pyotp for reliable QR code generation."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def generate_secret() -> str:
        """Generate secure random secret using pyotp."""
        return pyotp.random_base32()
    
    @staticmethod 
    def generate_qr_code(provisioning_uri: str) -> str:
        """Generate QR code as clean base64 data URL."""
        # Implementation details...
```

**Rationale**: Centralized service provides clean API abstraction and testability.

#### 3. Clean Base64 QR Code Generation
```python
def generate_qr_code(provisioning_uri: str) -> str:
    qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1, error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L)
    qr.add_data(provisioning_uri)
    qr_image = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")
    
    buffer = BytesIO()
    qr_image.save(buffer, format='PNG')
    qr_base64 = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode()
    return f"data:image/png;base64,{qr_base64}"
```

**Rationale**: Direct base64 encoding eliminates binary data serialization issues.

#### 4. Enhanced Manual Entry Formatting
```python
def format_secret_for_manual_entry(secret: str) -> str:
    """Format secret for manual entry (groups of 4 characters)."""
    chunks = [secret[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(secret), 4)]
    return ' '.join(chunks)
```

**Rationale**: Improves user experience for manual TOTP setup.

#### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Password validation before TOTP setup
- Graceful degradation if QR generation fails
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Proper exception handling throughout the flow

**Rationale**: Ensures robust production deployment and good developer experience.

### API Design Improvements

#### Enhanced Setup Response
```json
{
  "message": "Scan QR code with your authenticator app or enter the manual key",
  "device_id": 1,
  "qr_code": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...",
  "manual_key": "ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP QRST UVWX YZ23 4567",
  "next_step": "Enter a code from your authenticator app..."
}
```

**Rationale**: Provides multiple setup options and clear user guidance.

#### Security Considerations
- Secrets are never exposed in API responses (removed from production)
- Proper tenant isolation maintained
- Time-window validation for tokens
- Secure random secret generation

**Rationale**: Maintains security best practices while improving usability.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Fix django-otp Library Directly
**Rejected**: Would require forking and maintaining a custom version of django-otp, adding maintenance overhead and potential security risks.

### 2. Replace django-otp Completely
**Rejected**: Would require significant refactoring of existing 2FA infrastructure and admin interfaces. High risk and effort.

### 3. Client-side QR Generation
**Rejected**: Would expose TOTP secrets to frontend JavaScript, creating security vulnerabilities.

### 4. Remove QR Code Feature Entirely
**Rejected**: Would significantly degrade user experience and reduce 2FA adoption.

### 5. Use Different QR Library Only
**Rejected**: The core issue was with secret generation and binary data handling, not just QR code creation.

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
```python
pyotp==2.9.0          # RFC 6238 compliant TOTP implementation
qrcode[pil]==7.4.2     # QR code generation with PIL support
```

### File Structure
```
authn/
├── totp_service.py    # New enhanced TOTP service
├── views.py          # Updated SetupTOTPView and ConfirmTOTPView
├── serializers.py    # Added pyotp imports
└── models.py        # Existing django-otp models (unchanged)
```

### Integration Pattern
```python
# In views.py
def post(self, request):
    # Use enhanced TOTP service for setup
    setup_data = TOTPService.setup_totp_device(
        user=user,
        password=password,
        device_name=f'Authenticator App - {user.username}'
    )
    
    # Return clean JSON response
    return Response({
        'qr_code': setup_data['qr_code'],          # No Unicode issues
        'manual_key': setup_data['manual_entry_key'],  # Formatted nicely
        # ... other response data
    })
```

### Database Integration
- Maintains existing django-otp `TOTPDevice` model
- Uses pyotp for secret generation, stores in django-otp device
- Seamless integration with existing admin interface
- No migration required for existing data

## Consequences
