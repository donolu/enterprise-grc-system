# ADR 0020: Vendor Task Management Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - August 2025

## Context

Building on the comprehensive vendor management system (Story 3.1), we needed to implement automated task tracking and reminder functionality (Story 3.2) to ensure critical vendor activities like contract renewals, security reviews, and compliance assessments are never missed. This addresses a critical operational gap in vendor lifecycle management and prevents costly oversights.

### Business Requirements
- Procurement managers need automated contract renewal reminders with configurable advance notice
- Compliance teams require scheduled security assessments and compliance reviews based on vendor risk levels
- Operations teams need performance review tracking tied to contract terms and spending thresholds
- Management needs visibility into overdue tasks and vendor relationship health
- System must automatically generate tasks from existing vendor data and contract information
- Email notifications must be configurable and sent to appropriate stakeholders
- Professional admin interface needed for task management and bulk operations

### Technical Context
- Existing vendor management system with comprehensive vendor profiles and contract tracking
- Established email notification infrastructure for assessment reminders
- Multi-tenant Django application requiring complete data isolation
- RESTful API architecture using Django REST Framework
- Professional Django admin interfaces with visual enhancements and bulk operations
- Integration requirements with existing contract management and notification systems

## Decision

We decided to implement a comprehensive **Vendor Task Management System** with the following architecture:

### 1. Advanced Task Data Model

**VendorTask Model** with comprehensive task lifecycle management:

```python
# Core task tracking with automatic ID generation
class VendorTask(models.Model):
    task_id = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)  # TSK-YYYY-NNNN
    vendor = models.ForeignKey(Vendor, related_name='tasks')
    task_type = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=TASK_TYPE_CHOICES)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    
    # Scheduling and status
    due_date = models.DateField()
    start_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    completed_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    priority = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=PRIORITY_CHOICES)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=15, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
    
    # Assignment and ownership
    assigned_to = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='assigned_vendor_tasks')
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='created_vendor_tasks')
    
    # Reminder system
    reminder_days = models.JSONField(default=lambda: [30, 14, 7, 1])
    last_reminder_sent = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    reminder_recipients = models.JSONField(default=list, blank=True)
    
    # Integration with existing systems
    related_contract_number = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    service_reference = models.ForeignKey('VendorService', null=True, blank=True)
    
    # Automation and recurrence
    auto_generated = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    generation_source = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    is_recurring = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    recurrence_pattern = models.JSONField(default=dict, blank=True)
    parent_task = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **15 Task Types**: Contract renewals, security reviews, compliance assessments, audits, etc.
- **Automatic ID Generation**: Human-readable task IDs following established patterns (TSK-YYYY-NNNN)
- **Flexible Reminder System**: JSON-based reminder schedules with configurable intervals
- **Integration Points**: Links to existing vendor contracts and services
- **Recurrence Support**: Automatic generation of recurring tasks with pattern configuration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of task lifecycle and automation sources

### 2. Intelligent Task Automation System

**VendorTaskAutomationService** for automatic task generation:

```python
# Contract renewal task generation
def generate_contract_renewal_tasks(self):
    for vendor in vendors_with_contracts:
        notice_days = vendor.renewal_notice_days or 90
        task_due_date = vendor.contract_end_date - timedelta(days=notice_days)
        
        VendorTask.objects.create(
            vendor=vendor,
            task_type='contract_renewal',
            title=f"Contract Renewal - {vendor.name}",
            due_date=task_due_date,
            priority='high' if notice_days <= 30 else 'medium',
            auto_generated=True,
            generation_source='contract_expiry'
        )

# Security review scheduling based on risk level
def generate_security_review_tasks(self):
    review_frequencies = {
        'critical': 90,    # Every 3 months
        'high': 180,       # Every 6 months  
        'medium': 365,     # Annually
        'low': 730,        # Every 2 years
    }
```

    # Generate context-aware email content
    context = {
        'task': task,
        'vendor': task.vendor,
        'days_until_due': task.days_until_due,
        'is_overdue': task.is_overdue,
        'dashboard_url': self._get_dashboard_url(),
    }
    
    # Send reminder with appropriate urgency
    subject = self._generate_reminder_subject(task)
    content = self._render_reminder_text(context)
    
    # Update reminder tracking
    task.last_reminder_sent = timezone.now()
    task.save()

# Batch reminder processing
def send_daily_task_reminders():
    tasks_needing_reminders = [
        task for task in active_tasks 
        if task.should_send_reminder
    ]
    
    results = notification_service.send_batch_reminders(tasks_needing_reminders)
    return results
```

**Notification Features:**
- **Smart Reminder Logic**: Only send reminders when actually needed based on schedule

        'vendor__status', 'vendor__risk_level', 'due_date', 'created_at'
    ]
    
    # Bulk operations for efficiency
    actions = [
        'mark_as_completed', 'mark_as_in_progress', 'assign_to_me',
        'send_reminders', 'mark_as_high_priority'
    ]
```

### 6. Sophisticated Filtering Architecture

**VendorTaskFilter** supporting complex queries:

```python
# Multi-dimensional task filtering
class VendorTaskFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
    # Date-based intelligent filtering
    due_this_week = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_due_this_week')
    due_this_month = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_due_this_month')
    overdue = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_overdue')
    due_soon = django_filters.NumberFilter(method='filter_due_soon')
    
    # Performance and completion analysis
    completed_on_time = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_completed_on_time')
    completed_late = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_completed_late')
    
    # User-centric filtering
    assigned_to_me = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_assigned_to_me')
    created_by_me = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_created_by_me')
```

**Filtering Capabilities:**
- **Smart Date Filters**: Due this week/month, overdue, due within N days
- **Performance Metrics**: On-time vs late completion analysis
