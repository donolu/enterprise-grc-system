# ADR 0019: Vendor Management Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - August 2025

## Context

Following the successful implementation of comprehensive risk management capabilities (Stories 2.1-2.3), we needed to implement vendor management functionality (Story 3.1) to enable organizations to track vendors, manage associated risks, and monitor key contractual dates. This addresses a critical gap in third-party risk management and vendor relationship management.

### Business Requirements
- Procurement teams need comprehensive vendor profile management with contact tracking
- Risk managers require vendor risk assessment integration with existing risk management system
- Compliance teams need region-specific due diligence requirements and documentation
- Contract managers need renewal tracking, expiration alerts, and performance monitoring
- Organizations need multi-regional flexibility to accommodate varying compliance requirements
- System must support vendor lifecycle from onboarding to termination with complete audit trails

### Technical Context
- Existing multi-tenant Django application using django-tenants with PostgreSQL schema isolation
- Established risk management system with comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities
- Proven patterns from assessment management and risk management implementations
- RESTful API architecture using Django REST Framework with advanced filtering capabilities
- Azure Blob Storage integration for document management and evidence collection

## Decision

We decided to implement a comprehensive **Vendor Management System** with the following architecture:

### 1. Multi-Model Data Architecture

**Six Core Models** providing complete vendor lifecycle management:

```python
# Vendor profile and categorization
RegionalConfig: Region-specific compliance requirements and custom fields
VendorCategory: Vendor classification with risk weighting and compliance requirements
Vendor: Comprehensive vendor profiles with automatic ID generation (VEN-YYYY-NNNN)

# Relationship and service management
VendorContact: Multiple contacts per vendor with role-based organization
VendorService: Service catalog with risk assessment and data classification
VendorNote: Interaction tracking and decision documentation with audit trails
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Regional Flexibility**: JSON-based custom fields supporting region-specific requirements
- **Automatic ID Generation**: Human-readable vendor IDs following established patterns
- **Contact Management**: Multiple contacts per vendor with role-based categorization
- **Service Tracking**: Comprehensive service catalog with risk and cost tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Complete note system with internal/external visibility controls

### 2. Regional Configuration System

**Dynamic Regional Adaptation** supporting global compliance requirements:

```python
# Regional configuration structure
REGIONAL_CONFIGS = {
    "US": {
        "required_fields": {"tax_id": True, "duns_number": True},
        "custom_fields": [
            {"field_name": "ein_number", "validation": {"pattern": r"^\d{2}-\d{7}$"}},
            {"field_name": "minority_owned", "field_type": "boolean"}
        ],
        "compliance_standards": ["SOX", "HIPAA", "PCI-DSS", "CCPA"]
    },
    "EU": {
        "custom_fields": [
            {"field_name": "vat_number", "validation": {"pattern": r"^[A-Z]{2}[0-9A-Z]+$"}},
            {"field_name": "gdpr_representative", "required": True}
        ],
        "compliance_standards": ["GDPR", "ISO 27001", "NIS2"]
    }
}
```

**Regional Features:**
- **Pre-configured Regions**: US, EU, UK, Canada, APAC with specific requirements
- **Custom Field Validation**: Region-specific validation patterns and rules
- **Compliance Mapping**: Automatic assignment of relevant compliance frameworks
- **Extensible Design**: Easy addition of new regions without code changes

### 3. Comprehensive API Architecture

**RESTful Design** with advanced filtering and bulk operations:

```python
# Primary ViewSets with custom actions
VendorViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    - Standard CRUD with optimized tenant-scoped queries
    - Custom actions: update_status, add_note, bulk_create, summary
    - Advanced filtering: 25+ filter options including regional and compliance filters
    - Contract management: renewal tracking and expiration alerts
    - Analytics: summary statistics and category-based grouping

# Supporting ViewSets
VendorCategoryViewSet, VendorContactViewSet, VendorServiceViewSet, VendorNoteViewSet
```

**API Design Principles:**
- **Tenant Isolation**: All operations automatically scoped to requesting tenant
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic use of select_related and prefetch_related
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Complex queries for status, risk, contracts, and regions
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient mass vendor creation and management
- **Contract Intelligence**: Automated renewal alerts and expiration tracking

### 4. Advanced Filtering Architecture

**Multi-Dimensional Filtering** supporting complex vendor queries:

```python
# Vendor filtering capabilities
VendorFilter:
    - Basic filters: name, status, risk_level, vendor_type, category
    - Financial filters: annual_spend range, performance_score range
    - Contract filters: expiring_soon, expired, auto_renewal
    - Compliance filters: has_dpa, security_assessment_completed
    - Regional filters: operating_region, primary_region
    - Relationship filters: assigned_to_me, has_contacts, has_services
```

**Filter Features:**
- **Complex Date Ranges**: Contract expiration, relationship duration, assessment dates
- **Boolean Logic**: Multiple ways to query vendor characteristics
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **User-Centric**: Personal assignment and responsibility filtering

### 5. Professional Admin Interface

**Enhanced Django Admin** with visual indicators and bulk operations:

```python
# Admin interface enhancements
VendorAdmin:
    - Color-coded status and risk level indicators
    - Contract expiration warnings with visual alerts
    - Performance score displays with color-coded indicators
    - Inline contact, service, and note management
    - Bulk actions: status changes, user assignments, renewal reminders
    - Advanced search and filtering with relationship traversal
```

**Admin Features:**
- **Visual Design**: Color-coded indicators for status, risk, and performance
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass updates for status, assignments, and notifications
- **Relationship Management**: Direct links to related records and users
- **Performance Indicators**: Visual representations of scores and metrics

### 6. Contract Management Architecture

**Intelligent Contract Tracking** with automated alerts:

```python
# Contract management features
@property
def is_contract_expiring_soon(self):
    """Check if contract expires within renewal notice period"""
    
@property  
def days_until_contract_expiry(self):
    """Calculate days until contract expiration"""

# API endpoints for contract management
/api/vendors/contract_renewals/?days_ahead=90
```

**Contract Features:**
- **Expiration Tracking**: Automatic calculation of days until expiry
- **Renewal Alerts**: Configurable advance notice periods per vendor
- **Auto-Renewal Detection**: Identification of contracts with automatic renewal clauses
- **Performance Integration**: Contract renewal tied to performance assessments

## Rationale
