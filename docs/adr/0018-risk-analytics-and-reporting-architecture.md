# ADR 0018: Risk Analytics and Reporting Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - August 2025

## Context

Following the successful implementation of Risk Register (Story 2.1) and Risk Action Management (Story 2.2), we needed to provide comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities (Story 2.3) to enable data-driven risk management decisions. This includes executive dashboards, trend analysis, heat map visualizations, and comprehensive reporting for regulatory compliance and strategic planning.

### Business Requirements
- Executive teams need high-level risk visibility with KPIs and trend analysis
- Risk managers require detailed analytics on risk distributions, aging, and treatment effectiveness
- Compliance officers need comprehensive reporting for audit and regulatory requirements
- Dashboard users need real-time risk metrics with visual heat maps and progress tracking
- System administrators need embedded analytics within the admin interface for operational oversight
- Multi-tenant architecture requiring complete data isolation and performance optimization

### Technical Context
- Existing multi-tenant Django application using django-tenants with PostgreSQL schema isolation
- Established risk register with comprehensive risk data models and lifecycle management
- Active risk action system with treatment progress tracking and evidence management
- RESTful API architecture using Django REST Framework with comprehensive filtering
- Existing admin interface infrastructure with customization capabilities
- Database contains substantial risk data requiring efficient aggregation and analysis

## Decision

We decided to implement a comprehensive **Risk Analytics and Reporting System** with the following architecture:

### 1. Analytics Service Architecture

**Dual-Service Design** providing specialized analytics and report generation:

```python
# Core analytics service
RiskAnalyticsService:
    - get_risk_overview_stats: Comprehensive risk counts and distributions
    - get_risk_heat_map_data: Impact vs likelihood visualization data
    - get_risk_trend_analysis: Time-series risk creation and closure patterns
    - get_risk_action_overview_stats: Treatment action effectiveness metrics
    - get_risk_action_progress_analysis: Action completion and overdue analysis
    - get_risk_control_integration_analysis: Control framework alignment metrics
    - get_executive_risk_summary: High-level executive reporting

# Report generation service
RiskReportGenerator:
    - generate_risk_dashboard_data: Complete dashboard data compilation
    - get_risk_category_deep_dive: Category-specific detailed analysis
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Static Methods**: Stateless service methods for efficient caching and testing
- **Database Optimization**: Strategic use of aggregation, annotations, and bulk operations
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Risk level, status, category, and time-based analytics
- **Performance-First**: Optimized queries using Count, Avg, Sum with proper indexing
- **Extensible Architecture**: Service methods can be composed for custom reporting needs

### 2. API Architecture

**RESTful ViewSet** with comprehensive analytics endpoints:

```python
# Analytics ViewSet with custom actions
RiskAnalyticsViewSet(ViewSet):
    - dashboard: Complete dashboard data for frontend applications
    - risk_overview: Risk counts, distributions, and status analytics
    - action_overview: Risk action statistics and progress metrics
    - heat_map: Heat map visualization data (impact vs likelihood)
    - trends: Time-series trend analysis with configurable periods
    - action_progress: Detailed action completion and overdue analysis
    - executive_summary: High-level executive reporting data
    - control_integration: Control framework alignment analysis
    - category_analysis: Deep-dive category-specific analytics
```

**API Design Principles:**
- **Tenant Isolation**: All analytics automatically scoped to requesting tenant
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with graceful degradation
- **Flexible Parameters**: Configurable time periods and filtering options
- **Caching Ready**: Response structure optimized for future caching implementation
- **Documentation**: Full OpenAPI 3.0 documentation with real-world examples

### 3. Database Query Architecture

**Optimized Aggregation Strategy** for high-performance analytics:

```python
# Efficient query patterns
Risk.objects.values('risk_level').annotate(count=Count('id'))
Risk.objects.values('status').annotate(count=Count('id'))
Risk.objects.filter(created_at__gte=date_threshold).count()

# Advanced analytics with time-based grouping
Risk.objects.annotate(
    week=TruncWeek('created_at')
).values('week').annotate(count=Count('id'))

# Treatment effectiveness analysis
RiskAction.objects.exclude(status='completed').aggregate(
    avg=Avg('progress_percentage')
)
```

**Query Optimization Features:**
- **Strategic Indexing**: Database indexes on frequently queried fields (created_at, status, risk_level)
- **Bulk Operations**: Single queries for multiple metrics to reduce database round trips
- **Efficient Filtering**: Using exclude() and Q objects for complex conditions
- **Aggregation Functions**: Native database aggregation for better performance than Python processing

### 4. Admin Interface Integration

**Enhanced Admin Dashboard** with embedded analytics:

```python
# Admin dashboard integration
RiskAnalyticsDashboard:
    - get_admin_dashboard_data: Real-time admin metrics compilation
    - admin_dashboard_html: Rich HTML dashboard with visual indicators
    - Integration with existing RiskAdmin and RiskActionAdmin classes
```

**Admin Features:**
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Live risk counts, overdue actions, and completion rates
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded risk levels and progress displays
- **Quick Actions**: Direct links to high-priority items requiring attention
- **Responsive Design**: Professional styling that integrates seamlessly with Django admin
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient queries that don't impact admin page load times

### 5. Heat Map and Visualization Architecture

**Matrix-Based Risk Visualization** supporting multiple heat map formats:

```python
# Heat map data structure
heat_map_data = {
    'matrix_data': [
        {'impact': 'high', 'likelihood': 'high', 'count': 5, 'risks': [...]},
        {'impact': 'medium', 'likelihood': 'high', 'count': 3, 'risks': [...]}
    ],
    'impact_levels': ['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'],
    'likelihood_levels': ['rare', 'unlikely', 'possible', 'likely', 'almost_certain']
}
```

**Visualization Features:**
- **Flexible Matrix Sizes**: Support for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 risk matrices
- **Rich Metadata**: Risk counts, individual risk details, and drill-down capabilities
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color schemes for risk level visualization
- **Interactive Data**: Structured for frontend interactive heat maps and tooltips

### 6. Trend Analysis Architecture

**Time-Series Analytics** with configurable reporting periods:

```python
# Trend analysis capabilities
def get_risk_trend_analysis(days=90):
    - Risk creation trends over time with weekly/monthly grouping
    - Risk closure patterns and completion rates
    - Treatment action effectiveness over time
    - Comparative analysis between time periods
```

**Trend Features:**
- **Flexible Time Periods**: Default 90 days with configurable range
- **Multiple Grouping**: Weekly and monthly trend aggregation
- **Comparative Analysis**: Current vs previous period comparisons
- **Forecasting Ready**: Data structure supports future predictive analytics

### 7. Executive Reporting Architecture

**High-Level Executive Dashboard** with KPI focus:

```python
# Executive summary components
executive_summary = {
    'risk_overview': high_level_counts_and_percentages,
    'top_risks': highest_scored_risks_with_details, 
    'treatment_progress': action_completion_and_effectiveness,
    'compliance_status': regulatory_alignment_metrics,
    'trends': key_trend_indicators_and_changes
}
```

**Executive Features:**
