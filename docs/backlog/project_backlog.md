### EPIC 0: Foundations & Core Setup

*Objective: Establish the core technical foundation of the application, including the project structure, multi-tenancy, user authentication, billing, and deployment pipelines.*

#### User Stories:

*   **Story 0.1: Scaffold New Project Structure**
    *   **Status:** Done
    *   **Description:** As a Developer, I need to create the new Django project layout as defined in the blueprint, with separate directories for settings (`app/settings/`), modular applications (`core`, `authn`, etc.), and infrastructure (`infra/`, `docker/`).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        1.  The repository contains the new directory structure.
        2.  A `requirements.txt` file is created with all specified dependencies.
        3.  The project is configured with split settings for `local` and `production`.
        4.  A `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` are created to run the local development environment.
    *   **What was achieved:**
        1.  ✅ Complete modular Django project structure with apps: `core`, `authn`, `catalogs`, `compliance`, `risk`, `vendors`, `policies`, `training`, `vuln`, `events`, `audit`, `exports`, `search`, `api`
        2.  ✅ Comprehensive `requirements.txt` with all production dependencies including Django, DRF, django-tenants, Celery, WeasyPrint, Azure integrations
        3.  ✅ Split settings architecture (`app/settings/base.py`, `local.py`, `production.py`)
        4.  ✅ Multi-service Docker environment with PostgreSQL, Redis, Azurite, MailHog, OnlyOffice, OpenSearch, and Flower
        5.  ✅ Additional infrastructure: Makefile for common operations, proper middleware stack, Celery configuration
        6.  ✅ Development environment fully functional with hot reloading and all services integrated

*   **Story 0.2: Implement Multi-Tenancy (Schema per Tenant)**
    *   **Status:** Done
    *   **Description:** As a System Architect, I need to configure `django-tenants` to ensure complete data isolation for each client company using separate PostgreSQL schemas.
    *   **AC:**
        1.  When a new `Tenant` is created, a corresponding PostgreSQL schema is automatically created.
        2.  User and all tenant-specific data are created within the tenant's schema.
        3.  Middleware correctly identifies the tenant based on the request's subdomain (e.g., `client-a.grc.com`).
        4.  Users from one tenant cannot access data from another.
    *   **What was achieved:**
        1.  ✅ Full django-tenants integration with PostgreSQL schema isolation
        2.  ✅ Automatic schema creation via `create_tenant` management command
        3.  ✅ Tenant resolution via subdomain middleware (django-tenants)
        4.  ✅ Complete data isolation verified - users cannot cross-access tenants
        5.  ✅ Shared vs tenant app separation properly configured
        6.  ✅ Database migrations working for both shared and tenant schemas

*   **Story 0.3: Implement User Authentication & Registration**
    *   **Status:** Done

    *   **AC:**
        1.  A user registration page allows new users to sign up.
        2.  Users can log in using their email and password.
        3.  A robust password policy is enforced.
        4.  Users can log out, which invalidates their session.
        5.  The `core.User` model is linked to a `Tenant`.
    *   **What was achieved:**
        1.  ✅ RESTful API endpoints for registration (`POST /api/auth/register/`)
        2.  ✅ Login with username/email and password (`POST /api/auth/login/`)
        3.  ✅ Comprehensive password policy (8+ chars, complexity rules)
        4.  ✅ Session-based logout with CSRF protection (`POST /api/auth/logout/`)
        5.  ✅ User-tenant relationship via schema isolation (django-tenants approach)
        6.  ✅ Additional endpoints: profile management, password changes, user info
        7.  ✅ Complete multi-tenant isolation verified and tested
