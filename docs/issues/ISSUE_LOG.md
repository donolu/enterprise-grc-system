## ISSUE-0001: TOTP QR Code Generation Issue

**📋 Details:**
- **Status:** 🟢 Resolved
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Component:** Authentication (2FA TOTP)
- **Created:** 2025-08-22
- **Resolved:** 2025-08-22
- **Resolution Time:** Same day
- **Assignee:** Development Team
- **Reporter:** System Testing

**🐛 Problem:**
TOTP setup endpoint (`/api/auth/2fa/setup-totp/`) encountered Unicode encoding issues when attempting to return QR code data and manual keys for authenticator app setup. The error `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xde in position 1` occurred during JSON serialization.

**🔧 Root Cause:**
Django-OTP's binary key handling caused Unicode errors during JSON serialization in Django REST Framework responses.

**✅ Solution:**
Implemented enhanced TOTP service using `pyotp` library:
- Created new `TOTPService` class in `authn/totp_service.py`
- Updated API endpoints to use clean base32 secret generation
- Added QR code generation without Unicode issues
- Enhanced manual entry key formatting

**📦 Dependencies Added:**
- `pyotp==2.9.0` - RFC 6238 compliant TOTP implementation
- `qrcode[pil]==7.4.2` - QR code generation with PIL support

**🧪 Verification:**
- ✅ QR code generation works without Unicode errors
- ✅ JSON serialization completes successfully
- ✅ Compatible with all major authenticator apps
- ✅ Manual entry keys properly formatted
- ✅ Token verification functions correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage added

**📁 Files Modified:**
- `requirements.txt` - Added dependencies
- `authn/totp_service.py` - New enhanced TOTP service (created)
- `authn/views.py` - Updated SetupTOTPView and ConfirmTOTPView
- `authn/serializers.py` - Added pyotp imports

**📖 Documentation:**
- Issue details: `docs/issues/totp-qr-encoding-issue.md`
- Architecture decision: `docs/adr/0010-enhanced-totp-implementation-with-pyotp.md`

**🎯 Impact:**
- **Before:** ❌ TOTP setup completely broken for QR code scanning
- **After:** ✅ Seamless 2FA setup with QR codes and formatted manual keys
