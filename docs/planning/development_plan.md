# Development Plan

## 1. Overview & Methodology
This document outlines the phased development plan for the GRC SaaS platform. We will follow an Agile methodology, breaking down the work into the Epics and User Stories defined in the `docs/backlog/project_backlog.md`. Development will proceed in distinct phases, each delivering a significant set of functionalities.

## 2. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core MVP (Estimated: 4-6 weeks)
The primary goal of this phase is to build the foundational infrastructure and deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can onboard a test client and demonstrate the core compliance workflow.

*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   A fully containerized local development environment.
    *   A deployed application on Azure with a CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Multi-tenant user registration, authentication (with 2FA), and subscription management via Stripe.
    *   A functional ISO 27001 compliance module where users can assess controls and upload evidence to Azure Blob Storage.
    *   Automated email reminders for due dates.

### Phase 2: Expanding GRC Features (Estimated: 4-5 weeks)
This phase focuses on building out the remaining core GRC modules to create a comprehensive toolset for clients.

*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   A fully functional Risk Management module with automated risk scoring.
    *   A complete Vendor Management module with task tracking.
    *   A central repository for policies with versioning and an acknowledgment tracking system.
    *   Implementation of all other specified compliance frameworks (NIST, PCI, etc.).

### Phase 3: Advanced Integrations & UI Polish (Estimated: 3-4 weeks)
This phase adds high-value advanced features and focuses on refining the user experience to an enterprise-grade level.

*   **Key Outcomes:**
    *   Integration with ONLYOFFICE for inline document editing.
    *   A vulnerability management module capable of ingesting reports from scanners like OpenVAS.
    *   Client-facing analytics dashboards and data export capabilities (PDF/CSV).
    *   Integration with Synthesia.io for the training module.
    *   Full implementation of the beautiful UI theme, including light/dark modes.

## 3. Initial Sprint (Sprint 1)
Our immediate focus is on **Story 0.1: Scaffold New Project Structure**.

*   **Goals:**
    1.  Create the new Django project and application directory structure.
    2.  Set up the `compose.yml` file with all necessary services for local development.
    3.  Create the `Dockerfile` for the application.
    4.  Initialize the `requirements.txt` and `.env.dev.example` files.
    5.  Confirm that the local environment can be started successfully.
