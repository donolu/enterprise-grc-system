## Notification Types

### 1. Assignment Notifications
- Sent when user is assigned to a risk action
- Includes action details, due date, priority
- Configurable per user

### 2. Status Change Notifications
- Sent when action status changes
- Includes old/new status, progress updates
- Notifies assignee and risk owner

### 3. Evidence Upload Notifications
- Sent when new evidence is uploaded
- Includes evidence details and validation status
- Notifies relevant stakeholders

### 4. Reminder Notifications
- **Advance Warning**: Configurable days before due date
- **Due Today**: Sent on due date for pending actions
- **Overdue**: Daily reminders for overdue actions
- **Weekly Digest**: Summary of all assigned actions

## Celery Tasks

### Daily Reminder Processing
```python
@shared_task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
def send_risk_action_due_reminders(self):
    """Process and send due date reminders to all users."""
```

### Weekly Digest Generation
```python
@shared_task(bind=True, max_retries=3) 
def send_risk_action_weekly_digests(self):
    """Send weekly action summaries to users."""
```

### Individual Reminder Sending
```python
@shared_task
def send_immediate_risk_action_reminder(action_id, user_id, reminder_type):
    """Send individual action reminder."""
```

### Cleanup Tasks
```python
@shared_task
def cleanup_old_risk_action_reminder_logs(days_to_keep=90):
    """Clean up old reminder logs."""
```
